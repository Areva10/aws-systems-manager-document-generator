By default, this package is configured to run PyTest tests
(http://pytest.org/).

Prefix the test files with 'test_'.

Run the tests by calling:
$ brazil-build test

To run a single/few test files, just provide a path to the files:
$ brazil-build test -k TEST_PATTERN

Code coverage is automatically reported for <%=@python_package_name%>;
to add other packages, modify pytest.ini in the package root directory.

To debug the failing tests:
$ brazil-build test --pdb
will drop you into the Python debugger on the failed test.
